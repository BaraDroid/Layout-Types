Featured Layouts

* **Holy Grail Layout:** A classic three-column layout (header, left sidebar, main content, right sidebar, footer) that is still frequently used in complex web applications. This design is known for its flexibility and robust structure.

* **Hero Section:** The "hero section" is the prominent, often full-screen area at the top of a webpage. Its purpose is to immediately capture the user's attention.

* **Horizontal Scroll Section:** A modern layout pattern that makes a group of elements horizontally scrollable.
